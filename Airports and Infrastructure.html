 <h1>Airports and Infrastructure</h1>
 
  <h2>1.Runways:</h2>
  <h3>Runways are the main strips of pavement where aircraft take off and land.
     They are designed to handle different aircraft types and weather conditions.</h3>
 
  <h2>2.Taxiways:</h2>
  <h3>Taxiways connect runways with terminals, hangars, and other airport facilities.
    They guide aircraft between these points safely on the ground.</h3>
 
  <h2>3.Terminals:</h2>
  <h3>Terminals are buildings where passengers check in, go through security,
     board aircraft, and collect baggage after landing.</h3>
 
  <h2>4.Air Traffic Control (ATC):</h2>
  <h3>ATC is responsible for directing aircraft both on the
    ground and in the air to ensure safety and efficiency in flight operations.</h3>
 
  <h2>5.Ground Services and Logistics:</h2>
  <h3>These services include fueling, baggage handling, catering, maintenance,
    and cargo operations necessary for running airport activities smoothly.</h3>
